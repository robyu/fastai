This is my copy of Deep Learning for coders with Fastai and Pytorch:

```
@book{howard2020deep,
title={Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and Pytorch: AI Applications Without a PhD},

isbn={9781492045526},
url={https://books.google.no/books?id=xd6LxgEACAAJ},

```

I extracted the "clean" Jupyter notebooks from the original repository, and I'm adding my own notebooks as I work my way through the chapters.
